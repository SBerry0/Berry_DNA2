I wasn't really expecting it to do anything in terms of fully solving it, I just wanted to write stuff. I don't know if I'm going to continue debugging it or trying to do a new solution that goes character by character. |

The one I liked was the binary search one mostly because I fully thought of it and I think it's pretty creative. I knew it wasn't going to be very fast, but I wanted to see if it'd work, and unfortunately it doesn't seem like it would work. |
| Oct 12 | 4:45-5:50pm  | I started making a hash type of thing that you were talking about in class, but when I didn't I didn't really see how it would fit into the whole solution. So, I went back to takeTwo which I had paused work on and spent a lot of time in the debugger trying to figure out where it was going wrong. It turned out I was not pushing i forward for every STR I found so it was returning a maximum of one streak. I fixed this and it turned out well. Then I tried on all of them and it hit an index out of bounds error, so I fixed that by placing a check before and now it passes all tests. |
