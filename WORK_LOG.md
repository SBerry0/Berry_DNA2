| Oct 9  | 9:25-10:00am |                          I made my first try on the DNA part two using indexOf. I wasn't really expecting it to do anything in terms of fully solving it, I just wanted to write stuff. I don't know if I'm going to continue debugging it or trying to do a new solution that goes character by character. |
| Oct 10 | 1:45-3:00pm  | I had a few more attempts at different ways of solving it. The one I liked was the binary search one mostly because I fully thought of it and I think it's pretty creative. I knew it wasn't going to be very fast, but I wanted to see if it'd work, and unfortunately it doesn't seem like it would work. |
