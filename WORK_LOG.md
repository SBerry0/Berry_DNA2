I wasn't really expecting it to do anything in terms of fully solving it, I just wanted to write stuff. I don't know if I'm going to continue debugging it or trying to do a new solution that goes character by character. |

The one I liked was the binary search one mostly because I fully thought of it and I think it's pretty creative. I knew it wasn't going to be very fast, but I wanted to see if it'd work, and unfortunately it doesn't seem like it would work. |
| Oct 12 |  4:45-5:50pm  |                                                                              I started making a hash type of thing that you were talking about in class, but when I didn't I didn't really see how it would fit into the whole solution. So, I went back to takeTwo which I had paused work on and spent a lot of time in the debugger trying to figure out where it was going wrong. It turned out I was not pushing i forward for every STR I found so it was returning a maximum of one streak. I fixed this and it turned out well. Then I tried on all of them and it hit an index out of bounds error, so I fixed that by placing a check before and now it passes all tests. |

I tried initially doing it in the way that Sedgewick did it, but that didn't make too much intuitive sense to me, so I used different variables to write my own. I'm pretty sure the nextHash works, but we'll see. I also changed teh character translation into the radix of four to a map to make it quicker. |
| Oct 22 | 10:00-11:15pm | I continued with the Sedgewick method of trying to do it now after running into a roadblock with my own approach. I could adapt his code pretty easily because I had already done a window type of thing with my takeTwo, however I had trouble shifting the hash when a pattern was found. I knew I had to iterate the hash as well as the index from prior learnings from takeTwo where I had to do a similar thing. But it took a little bit of time in the debugger to figure out what my values should be for the range of iteration. I pass the first two tests, but I'm running into an error where non-acceptable characters are in the file. I'll deal with that tomorrow. |

I fixed it pretty quickly and then added comments to everything. |
